  I have heard from 2 people using this font commercially, one with
  very good results, one still in testing.  If I can get some semi-official
  testimonials, I'll add them.  But suffice it to say that my confidence
  in the font has increased.  :)

  I have someone who is willing to test the TTF version of this font in
  the real world, on a fairly large scale... we'll see how it goes!

  The TTF version was just converted by a font program, so I have no
  idea if conversion errors were introduced.
